objective will be to achieve a metric that shows the similarity between both sentences. This problem entails significant challenges since language is not easy to model due to the large number of synonyms, similar expressions, and words with more than one meaning. Likewise, the similarity between texts has a wide range of real-world applications, such as automatic text correction or in virtual assistants and chatbots.\n","\n","Therefore, in this project, we will work with a wide variety of features that can be extracted from the text to propose an efficient solution to this problem. Regarding the sentences to be used, we specifically employ the dataset and event description from the Semantic Textual Similarity task of SemEval-2012 Task 6.\n","\n","Finally, in addition to the final features we will extract from the text, we will also consider options for text cleaning or preprocessing, as well as address the various strategies implemented in the event."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9hju28MO1T7u"},"source":["---\n","## Project Structure\n","\n","This project will begin with the reading and concatenation of all the available data.

This finding aligns with the fundamental principle that lexical features are essential in language.\n","\n","The challenge with syntactic features lies in their primary focus on sentence structure and grammar, rather than on the meaning conveyed by the words themselves. This distinction becomes particularly evident when evaluating sentence similarity. For instance, two sentences can share identical syntactic structures but convey entirely different meanings. In such scenarios, models based only on syntax struggle to accurately assess similarity, as they lack access to the semantic richness provided by lexical content.\n","\n","However, it is noteworthy that our syntactic model achieved a respectable performance, as indicated by a Pearson Correlation of 0.6572.

A part from the techniques learned in class we have used a spell checker to ensure there were no spelling errors.\n","\n","Subsequently, we developed a diverse array of features. These features were meticulously crafted to capture both lexical and syntactic dimensions of the text, supplemented by multiple similarity functions.\n","\n","A key aspect of our approach was the application of various machine learning methods. These methods were chosen to effectively make use the potential of the generated features, outputing a sophisticated sentence similarity value.\n","\n","Throughout our exploration, we observed a notable impact of lexical and syntactic features on the performance of our models. It became evident that lexical features, with their inherent ability to convey meaning, were more influential compared to syntactic features in the context of paraphrase detection.\n","\n","Feature reduction methods were a significant component of our methodology, particularly Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The application of PCA not only streamlined our feature set but also enhanced the overall performance of our models.\n","\n","Lastly, we tried data augmentation, although very interesting, it did not yield the anticipated improvement in results.\n","\n","In summary, our work demonstrates the challenges involved in detecting paraphrasing through sentence similarity metrics."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Finally, we display the performance of our different models in the following table:\n","\n","| Model           | Correlation | Features |\n","|-----------------|-------------|----------|\n","| Lexical         | 0.7567      | 74       |\n","| Syntactic       | 0.6572      | 44       |\n","| Complete        | 0.7666      | 89       |\n","| Manual Selection| 0.7629      | 20       |\n","| PCA             | 0.7676      | 12       |\n","| PCA Augmented   | 0.7635      | 12       |"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["---\n","## Biblography"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Šarić, F., Glavaš, G., Karan, M., Šnajder, J., & Bašić, B.
